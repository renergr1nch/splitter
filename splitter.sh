#       BSD License - Do whatever you want with this script, but take the responsibility!
#
#	We do not support who will use this script for illegal proposes. 
#	If you will use this script for any illegal propose I'm not responsible for your acts.
#
#	This script has been created to support people to protect themselves, their children and their dignity while using Internet.
#	Also to support you to keep your data safe, and confidential. The privacy is your right!
#	It was created to help Journalists, Activists, Military, Pentesters and people who deals with sensitive data every day during
#	exercise of their job activities.
#
#	This script has been created to help you to use the TOR NETWORK every single day, any time. 
#	Even to watch movies on-line in the Youtube in HIGH DEFINITION. Yes! Now it's possible even using the tor network.
#
#	Before you just run this script, I strongly recommend you to activate your ANONYMOUS VPN connection! Never connect straight to the TOR network!
#	Stay safe! Stay anonymous! Stay in the shadows!
#
#
#
#	== How it works? ==
#		
#	The idea behind this script is to stop the tracking of your actions on the "Internet" or inside the "DeepWeb" by difficulty 
#	the correlations of the events.
#	In another words, even that an adversary can control a TOR ENTRY NODE or a TOR EXIT NODE, this script will make the correlations
#	of events inside the TOR network almost impossible because it splits and send every request using different TOR circuit
#	running from different countries around.
#
#	By using the TOR GeoIP, this script allows you to create many TOR instances using different countries as TOR ENTRY and 
#   different countries as TOR EXIT nodes, performing the LOAD BALANCING and making sure that all your requests will hit the target.
#
#	The speed and stability has been considered for many people the huge problem of TOR NETWORK and now you can use it with the same speed of your 
#	"normal Internet connection". That's it!
#   Yes! We are talking about HIGH AVAILABILITY and HIGH SPEED even considering the TOR NETWORK which is being improved but still being considered a very unstable network.
#
#
# 	== DEPENDENCIES:== 
# 	1) tor 	 	 	--> version 0.3.3.6 or earlier - https://www.torproject.org/
# 	2) privoxy 	 	--> version 3.0.26  or earlier - http://www.privoxy.org/
# 	3) haproxy 	 	--> version 1.7.5-2 or earlier - https://www.haproxy.org/
# 	4) proxychains  --> version 3.1	 	or earlier - https://sourceforge.net/projects/proxychains/
# 	5) expect		--> version 5.45	or earlier - https://sourceforge.net/projects/expect/
#
#
#
#	== How to use: ==
#
#	1) Execute the splitter.sh script and wait until TOR finish the load process of all requested instances. Press CTRL+C to close the status screen.
#		Sintax:
#		$ /bin/bash splitter.sh -i <INSTANCES> -c <COUNTRIES> -re <RELAY ENFORCE MODE>
#
#		Sample: $ /bin/bash splitter.sh -i 2 -c 20 -re entry
#
#		It will select 20 different countries and create 2 TOR instances for each selected country. In summary you will have 40 TOR instances.
#		By default the script will select random countries to create the requested number of TOR INSTANCES.
#		The script will start a HTTP PROXY (MASTER PROXY) on port 3128 of the localhost.
# 		Every program that points their connections to this proxy will send and receive data spliting theis request between all requested TOR instances.
#		
#
#	2) Set the proxy 127.0.0.1:3128 in your brownser and enjoy your anonymous, secure and fast TOR connection.
